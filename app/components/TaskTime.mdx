# TaskTime Component

The TaskTime component displays the time for a task with proper formatting.

## Overview

The TaskTime component is responsible for displaying the time associated with a task. It:
- Shows the time with appropriate styling
- Applies lighter color when the task is completed
- Includes a smooth transition animation when toggling between states
- Can be customized with additional classes

This component is typically used within the TaskItem component to display the scheduled time for a task.

## Examples

### Morning Time

<Canvas of={TaskTimeStories.Morning} />

### Morning Time (Completed)

<Canvas of={TaskTimeStories.MorningCompleted} />

### Afternoon Time

<Canvas of={TaskTimeStories.Afternoon} />

### Evening Time

<Canvas of={TaskTimeStories.Evening} />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

```tsx
import { TaskTime } from './components/TaskTime';

// Basic usage
<TaskTime 
  time="10:00 AM" 
/>

// Completed task time
<TaskTime 
  time="7:00 AM" 
  completed={true} 
/>

// With additional className
<TaskTime 
  time="3:30 PM" 
  className="font-semibold" 
/>
```

## Design Considerations

- The component uses a smaller text size for the time to provide visual hierarchy
- When the associated task is completed, the time is styled with a lighter color
- The transition between states is animated for a smoother user experience
- The component can be customized with additional classes for different styling needs
