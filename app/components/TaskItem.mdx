# TaskItem Component

The TaskItem component displays a single task with checkbox, text, and optional time.

## Overview

The TaskItem component combines several smaller components to create a complete task item:
- TaskCheckbox for toggling the completion state
- TaskText for displaying the task description
- TaskTime for showing the scheduled time (if provided)

It also includes:
- Hover and focus states for better user experience
- Proper spacing and alignment of all elements
- Truncation for long text to maintain layout
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Examples

### Default Task

<Canvas of={TaskItemStories.Default} />

### Completed Task

<Canvas of={TaskItemStories.Completed} />

### Task Without Time

<Canvas of={TaskItemStories.WithoutTime} />

### Task With Long Text

<Canvas of={TaskItemStories.LongText} />

### Interactive Task

Try clicking on the checkbox to toggle the completion state:

<Canvas of={TaskItemStories.Interactive} />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

```tsx
import { TaskItem } from './components/TaskItem';
import { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [completed, setCompleted] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <TaskItem 
      text="Buy groceries" 
      completed={completed}
      time="10:00 AM"
      onToggle={() => setCompleted(!completed)}
    />
  );
};
```

## Design Considerations

- The component uses a flexible layout to accommodate different content lengths
- The checkbox is positioned on the left for easy access
- The task text takes up the available space and truncates if necessary
- The time is positioned on the right for consistent alignment
- When completed, all elements update their styling to provide visual feedback
- Hover states are included for better interactivity
- The component is designed to work within a list of tasks with proper spacing
