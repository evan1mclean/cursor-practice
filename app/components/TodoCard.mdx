# TodoCard

The TodoCard component is the main container for the Todo List application. It combines multiple components (DateHeader, TaskList, AddTaskButton) to create a complete todo list card with proper layout and functionality.

## Features

- Displays the current date with proper formatting
- Shows the number of tasks
- Renders a list of tasks with the ability to toggle completion
- Includes a HeaderDivider with an AddTaskButton positioned on the divider line
- Maintains state for tasks within the component
- Handles task toggling functionality

## Component Structure

The TodoCard is composed of several key components:

1. **CardHeader** - Contains the DateHeader with date and task count
2. **HeaderDivider** - A divider line with the AddTaskButton positioned on it
3. **CardContent** - Contains the TaskList with all tasks

## Usage

```tsx
import { TodoCard } from './components/TodoCard';
import { Task } from './components/TaskList';

// Sample initial tasks
const initialTasks: Task[] = [
  { id: '1', text: 'Morning Run', completed: true, time: '7:00 AM' },
  { id: '2', text: 'Buy Pizza on the way to work', completed: false, time: '8:00 AM' },
];

// In your component
<TodoCard initialTasks={initialTasks} />
```

## Props

<Controls />
