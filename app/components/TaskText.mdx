# TaskText Component

The TaskText component displays the text of a task with support for completed state styling.

## Overview

The TaskText component is responsible for displaying the text content of a task. It:
- Shows the task text with appropriate styling
- Applies strikethrough and lighter color when the task is completed
- Includes a smooth transition animation when toggling between states
- Can be customized with additional classes

This component is typically used within the TaskItem component to display the task description.

## Examples

### Default (Incomplete Task)

<Canvas of={TaskTextStories.Default} />

### Completed Task

<Canvas of={TaskTextStories.Completed} />

### Long Text

<Canvas of={TaskTextStories.LongText} />

### Long Text (Completed)

<Canvas of={TaskTextStories.LongTextCompleted} />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

```tsx
import { TaskText } from './components/TaskText';

// Basic usage
<TaskText 
  text="Buy groceries" 
  completed={false} 
/>

// Completed task
<TaskText 
  text="Morning Run" 
  completed={true} 
/>

// With additional className
<TaskText 
  text="Important meeting" 
  completed={false} 
  className="font-semibold" 
/>
```

## Design Considerations

- The component uses a base text size with appropriate line height for readability
- When completed, the text is styled with a strikethrough and lighter color
- The transition between states is animated for a smoother user experience
- The component can be customized with additional classes for different styling needs
