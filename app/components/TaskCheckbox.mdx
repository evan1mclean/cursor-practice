# TaskCheckbox Component

The TaskCheckbox component provides a custom styled checkbox for tasks with checked and unchecked states and smooth animation.

## Overview

The TaskCheckbox component is a custom-styled checkbox that:
- Has distinct checked and unchecked visual states
- Includes a smooth animation when toggling between states
- Is accessible with proper ARIA attributes
- Has focus and hover states for better user experience

This component is typically used within the TaskItem component to allow users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

## Examples

### Unchecked State

<Canvas of={TaskCheckboxStories.Unchecked} />

### Checked State

<Canvas of={TaskCheckboxStories.Checked} />

### Interactive Example

Try clicking on the checkbox to see the animation:

<Canvas of={TaskCheckboxStories.Interactive} />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

```tsx
import { TaskCheckbox } from './components/TaskCheckbox';
import { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <TaskCheckbox 
      checked={isChecked} 
      onChange={() => setIsChecked(!isChecked)} 
    />
  );
};
```

## Design Considerations

- The component uses a circular design with a checkmark icon for better visual appeal
- When checked, the background changes to the secondary color (coral/salmon) for clear visual feedback
- The component includes a subtle animation when toggling between states
- The checkbox is properly sized for touch targets on mobile devices
- Focus states are included for keyboard navigation
- The actual checkbox input is visually hidden but remains accessible for screen readers
